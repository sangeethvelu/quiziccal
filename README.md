# Quiziccal

Hey there, This is a website that I designed where users can take a short quiz game based on any given categories. The app features a wide range of quizzes covering various topics, from history and science to pop culture and entertainment. With simple and intuitive navigation, users can easily select the quiz of their choice and start answering questions.
